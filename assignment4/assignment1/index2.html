Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who had a dog named Sparky. Sparky was a small, brown dog with big, floppy ears. Timmy and Sparky were best friends. They played together every day, and Sparky even slept in Timmy's bed at night.
<br>
One day, Timmy and Sparky were playing in the park when Sparky ran off after a squirrel. Timmy chased after him, but he couldn't find him. Timmy was heartbroken. He searched everywhere for Sparky, but he couldn't find him.
  <h1><hr>2nd PARAGRAPH</h1>
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah who was afraid of the dark. She would always sleep with the light on, and she would never go into a dark room alone.
<br><br>
One day, Sarah's family went on a camping trip. Sarah was scared to sleep in the tent, but she knew she had to be brave. She lay in her sleeping bag and listened to the sounds of the night. She heard the wind in the trees, the crickets chirping, and the owls hooting.

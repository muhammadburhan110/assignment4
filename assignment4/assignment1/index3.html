  <p>One day, Timmy and Sparky were playing in the park when Sparky ran off after a squirrel. Timmy chased after him, but he couldn't find him. Timmy was heartbroken. He searched everywhere for Sparky, but he couldn't find him.</p>
  <p>A few days later, Timmy was walking home from school when he saw a familiar brown dog sitting on his front porch. It was Sparky! Timmy ran up to him and hugged him tightly. He was so happy to have his best friend back.</p>

  <h1>The Brave Little Girl</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah who was afraid of the dark. She would always sleep with the light on, and she would never go into a dark room alone.</p>
  <p>One day, Sarah's family went on a camping trip. Sarah was scared to sleep in the tent, but she knew she had to be brave. She lay in her sleeping bag and listened to the sounds of the night. She heard the wind in the trees, the crickets chirping, and the owls hooting.</p>
  <p>Sarah started to feel scared, but then she remembered something her father had told her. He had said that the dark is nothing to be afraid of. It's just the absence of light. And there's nothing to be afraid of in the absence of light.</p>
  <p>Sarah closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She was still scared, but she was also determined to be brave. She imagined herself as a strong, brave warrior. She imagined herself facing her fears and overcoming them.</p>
  <p>Sarah opened her eyes and looked around the tent. She wasn't afraid anymore. She knew that she could do anything she set her mind to. She closed her eyes and fell asleep, dreaming of all the amazing things she would do in the future.</p>
